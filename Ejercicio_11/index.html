A long time ago in an unspecefied time period there were to spitiual locations for
departed souls, heaven and hell, the resting places for the souls of good heart and
the wasting grounds for the dammed ones respectivly.

Until one day... they arrived... the machines of wood and flesh emanating
the darkness of the universe arrived... for their fuel.

Out of nowhere flying vessels soared the skies hitting any angel or demon that was in their
target sight, winged creatures with yellow skulls deployed from the vessels to collect every
soul avalible, it didint matter if it was a holy soul or a sinful one, it was all fuel and 
nothing else.

The gods of heaven and hell arrvied to see their domains being ravaged by machinery, unphased by
the carnage the gods casted thunder and winds to swiftly dispose of the nuisance, but they never 
accounted for one small detail, who was controlling these machines?

They would find out the moment they finished destroying the army... the chains started to move..
From the grounds of the depths of hell emerged chains to bring downs the heavens, attempting to destroy
the holy resting place and destroying hell with it
and there was nothing they could do as an unknown force is preventing the gods to stop it,
angels started to fall, structures crumble in the dust, the fires of hell started to morph into goo,
the ground was staring to level as if it's in the middle of an nuclear explosion.

The gods are speachless, and in the mids of all the chaos... he arrived... the man who destroyed the skies
and the earth, the man... who will destroy the gods.

The Reaper King: Dark Nebula.

A man of purple hair and suit, pale skin with red and yellow eyes, a playful look to mock his enemies.
He appered on the back of the gods, teasing them for their failure at resistance, the gods immidiatly started
to attack him, fast thunder, beems of energy emanating from the hands of the good of hell, winds casted by
the god of the heavens, explosions coming from both of them, fire, blades, supernovas... nothing was working.

No matter what they tried it would not work, all the Reaper King did was laugh as it was dodging attacks,
eventually he was getting bored as the destruction was nearing a breaking point, so he executed his next move...

He was going to kill the gods and use their souls to make himself more powerfull.

In the middle of the fight, Dark Nebula took out a rod with a spiral like disk at the tip from his suit, he pointed
it upwards bliding the gods, and in that moment, a black void started to form, the heavens and hell started to
break down and it was creating an explosion that would liberate all the energy that was being exposed from the damaged
caused from the carnage.

The gods, regaining their sight discovered that Dark Nebula dissapared, they looked around them and found nothing...
he was hiding from their backs, and in that moment he screamed...

"GAME, OVER!!!"

In that moment, the bodies of the gods vanished and all that was left was their souls that were quickly
absorbed by the Reaper King to become powerfull, the god slayer maniacly laughed as screams of angels and demons
were being silenced one by one by his army, anticipating the fallout he commanded his army to leave,
the mission was a sucess.

And after leaving with an incomprehensible amount of souls... the heaven and hell were sucked into a dark 
void, letting out a giant explosion, all that remanied was dust and the cries of the souls of both mortals, angels
and demons, their home and prison no longer exist.

All that was left, was a death paradise.
